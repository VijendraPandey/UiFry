## A brief description of the design choices and any libraries used.
**Layout Structure:** The layout is structured using HTML5 semantic element like \<section> which enhance accessibility and SEO. The use of Flexbox and CSS Grid in the CSS ensures a responsive and flexible layout.

**Fonts:** The website utilizes custom fonts imported from external sources using @font-face rule, providing a unique and visually appealing typography. Clash Display font is used for headings, adding a modern and bold aesthetic to the text.

**Icons:** Remixicon and custom SVG icons are used throughout the website for visual elements and navigation. Remixicon provides a vast collection of modern and customizable icons, enhancing the user experience.

**Animations:** CSS animations are employed for subtle effects like the star animations and the gooey effect. These animations add visual interest and interactivity to the website, creating a dynamic user experience.

**External Libraries:** The website makes use of external libraries like Remixicon for icons and Font Share for custom fonts. These libraries provide a convenient way to incorporate high-quality resources into the website without the need for custom development.

`Overall, the design choices aim to create a visually appealing and user-friendly website that effectively communicates information and engages visitors.`
